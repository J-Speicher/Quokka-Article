## Specs

1. mark up the text in the html file (modified from wikipedia) with the appropriate tags
    * the submission must pass html validation
1. tell the html file to use the provided css file
1. make the page look like the provided image, specifically:
    1. The _main_ text has a width of `50rem`.
    1. the _figures_ have a width of `43rem`.
    1. The main text and figures are centered horizontally in the page.
    1. The margin notes have a width of  `12.5rem`.
    1. The margin notes are "anchored" against their _containing_ paragraphs.
    1. The margin notes have a bg color of üêë (`#BABABA` üòÇ).
    1. The margin notes have a text size of `0.75rem`.
    1. The gap between the main text and the margin notes is `1rem`.
    1. remove the placeholder style that makes the page awful (but totally helps ensure you've told the html file to use the css file)
    1. captions for the images should have a text size of `0.5rem`.
