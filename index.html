        An estimated 4,000 quokkas occur on the mainland, with nearly all mainland populations being groups of fewer than 50,
        although one declining group of over 700 occurs in the southern forest between Nannup and Denmark.

            The quokka (/'kwɒkə/) (Setonix brachyurus), the only member of the genus Setonix, is a small macropod about the
            size of a domestic cat.

      In 2007, the quokka population on Rottnest Island was estimated at between 8,000 and 12,000. Snakes are the quokka's
      only predator on the island. The population on smaller Bald Island, where the quokka has no predators, is 600-1,000.
      At the end of summer and into autumn, a seasonal decline of quokkas occurs on Rottnest Island, where loss of
      vegetation
      and reduction of available surface water can lead to starvation.

      Quokka behavior in response to human interaction has been examined in zoo environments. One brief study indicated
      fewer animals remained visible from the visitor paths when the enclosure was an open or walk-through environment.
      This may have been due to the quokkas acquiring avoidance behavior of visitors, which the authors propose has
      implications for stress management in their exhibition to the public.
